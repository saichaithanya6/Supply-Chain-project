To increase the sales of Homebody furniture, we can implement combo offers that involve bundling products such as chairs and tables. To determine the best months to offer these promotions, we can analyze historical sales data and identify the months with the lowest sales throughout the year for these products. By offering combo deals during these low-sales months, we can incentivize customers to purchase more products and reduce leftover inventory. This 
strategy can help increase sales and improve overall profitability for our company.
## Visualizing the datasets
For visualizing the data of tables and chairs, the data of tables and chairs are obtained. Below is the data of tables and chairs.

After obtaining the datasets of the chairs and tables, we visualized the dataset of tables and chairs by using the plotly package.

Based on the data presented in the sales of chairs graph, it is evident that there is a recurring pattern of low sales for chairs during the month of August. This trend is
observed consistently over the years and can be seen through the decline in the sales figures for chairs during the month of August, compared to any other months.

Based on the sales data for tables, it has been observed that the month of October consistently has the lowest sales figures every year. To address this issue and increase 
sales, it may be beneficial to introduce a combo offer with chairs. By bundling tables and chairs together, customers may be more inclined to make a purchase, resulting in 
increased sales for both products. On average, the sales of tables during October are around 413 units, which suggests that there is potential for significant sales growth 
by implementing this strategy.
