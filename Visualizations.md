To increase the sales of Homebody furniture, we can implement combo offers that involve bundling products such as chairs and tables. To determine the best months to offer these promotions, we can analyze historical sales data and identify the months with the lowest sales throughout the year for these products. By offering combo deals during these low-sales months, we can incentivize customers to purchase more products and reduce leftover inventory. This 
strategy can help increase sales and improve overall profitability for our company.
